How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?

This data structure allows developers to create pixels of specific colors,
forces them to be within acceptable values, and using the separate Screen class developers
can place said pixels anywhere in a matrix and alter the pixels x & y properties.

If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?

If a developer wanted to find a pixel they would search using the x & y values by calling
screen.at(x, y)

What other real-world data can each structure represent?

On a larger scale, and more methods this could be the foundation for how
any digital display alters the colors of pixels on a screen to display an image.
