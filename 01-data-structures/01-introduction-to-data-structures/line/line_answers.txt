How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?

The Line class allows developers to add persons to the end of the line (by name),
remove anyone from the line (by name),
retrieve the name of the person from the front, back and/or middle,
or simply search by name to see if a person
is in line.

If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?

A developer can search by:
Line.members.front #=> returns person at front of the line
Line.members.middle #=> returns person at the middle of the line.
Line.members.back #=> returns person at the back of the line.
Line.members.search(name) #=> returns true if variable "name" is in the line.


What other real-world data could this structure represent?

This data structure could represent
any queue related activity; persons, dogs, cattle, inventory...
the possibilities are endless!
