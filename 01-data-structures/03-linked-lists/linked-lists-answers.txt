What is Spatial Locality and why does it benefit performance?

  Spatial locality refers to the use of data elements within relatively close storage locations.
  It benefits performance because it limits the amount of times a computer has to access the
  RAM to find a range of data to place in the cache, (reading from RAM takes longer than
  reading from the cache).

Compare the performance of an Array to a Linked List using the Benchmark module.



  Compare the time it takes to create a 10,000 item Array to appending 10,000 items to a Linked List.

    0.000026 sec to create 10,000 item Array vs. 0.002525 sec to append 10,000 items to a Linked List.
    Linked list is just over 97 times slower!

  Compare the time it takes to access the 5000th element of the Array and the 5000th Node in the Linked List.

    0.000005 sec to access the 5000th element of the Array vs. 0.000352 sec to access the 5000th Node in Linked List.
    Linked list is 70 times slower (assuming my find_index function is working correctly).

  Compare the time it takes to remove the 5000th element from the Array to removing the 5000th Node in the Linked List.
  In the Array, the 5001st item becomes the 5000th, and so on.

    0.000010 sec to remove the 5000th element from the Array vs. 0.000353 sec to remove the 5000th Node in Linked List.
    Linked list is 35 times slower (assuming my delete_index function is working correctly).
