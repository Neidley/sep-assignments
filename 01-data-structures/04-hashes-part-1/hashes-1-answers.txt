Explain why doubling the size of the underlying array of your HashClass may be a poor idea.

  Doubling the size of the area increases the number of open slots in the array
  for potential values which may lead to more fragmentation.
  Resizing based on prime numbers reduces the number of collisions.
  Also, doubling the size of the array (allocating memory) slows operation because every
  entry has to be evaluated and re-indexed.
