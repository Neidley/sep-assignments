# Data Structures

### General Overview

  This repository is a record of my bootcamp assignments concerning data structures.

  Data Structures organize data in a way that renders it easier to use and manipulate.

  Most programming languages provide the features necessary to implement all data structures.


### Data Structures covered

  Stacks -

       The Stack data structure arranges elements in LIFO priority.  

  LIFO -

       "Last in First Out", The last element is the first to leave.  

  Queues -

       The Queue data structure arranges elements in FIFO priority.  

  FIFO -

     "First in First Out", The first element processed is the first to leave.  

  Linked Lists -

       A Linked List provides Array-like functionality, but the memory address (location) of each element in the list is unpredictable. Elements in a Linked List are not stored next to one another in memory. A series of nodes compose every Linked List and each node contains a piece of data and the address (reference) of the next node in the list.  


   Ruby’s Hash Class	-

       Ruby’s Hash class is one of the most well-designed hash data structures available to developers.  

   Hashing Function -

       A hashing function converts data of arbitrary size to a fixed size. In a hash structure, it must convert a string key to a fixed-length number: a hash code.  

   MurmurHash -

       The Hash class uses the MurmurHash function to generate fixed-length hash codes.  

   Separate Chaining -

       A collision resolution strategy that appends new elements to a chain located at the bucket.  

   Open Addressing -

       A collision resolution strategy that searches for the nearest empty location.  

   Binary Trees -

       A Binary Tree is a data structure in which each Node may point to a left child and a right child.  

   Binary Search Tree -

       A Binary Search Tree (BST) orders each Node in the Tree based on some quantifiable value. Generally, Nodes increase in value as we travel right, and decrease in value towards the left.  

   Heap -

       A Heap orders each Node in the Tree based on a heap property.  

   Heap Property -

       A Heap Property is the rule by which a Heap organizes itself. In order for a Heap to maintain utility, all Nodes must adhere to the Heap Property.  

   Graph -

       A Graph is any collection of data points connected to one another by edges. Trees and Linked Lists are examples of specialized Graph structures.
